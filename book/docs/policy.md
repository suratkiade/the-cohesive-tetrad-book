# Portal policy

## Canonical authority

The canonical record is the DOI release and the canonical repository. This portal does not redefine, amend, or reinterpret the manuscript.

## Translations and derivatives

Translations or derivative works are outside the scope of this portal. Any such work must reference the canonical DOI and repository and must not claim to replace them.

## No derivation rule

This portal only publishes a reading edition built from canonical sources. It does not author new philosophical content.

## Report an issue

To report a portal issue, open a ticket in the canonical repository: <https://github.com/suratkiade/the-cohesive-tetrad/issues>.
